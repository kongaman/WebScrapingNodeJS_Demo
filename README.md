# WebScrapingNodeJS_Demo
Udemy - Web Scraping using NODE JS with Projects from scratch

Web scrapping is the Data Science technique of gathering or storing useful and public information from websites in a suitable format like spreadsheets that can be used later for any purpose. It basically removes the burden of copying the data manually, instead it provides an automated way to do it.

The data extraction is done from websites using some sort of a code written called “scraper” which takes the a Web URL, parses the HTML DOM of that site and then return the result which we can save in some format say CSV for future use. The data that we parse can be in form of texts, images, package names and their corresponding prices, videos and contact information like email, name, phone numbers and so on.

This course is built in NODEJS that is light weight, efficient, and scale-able  due to its non-blocking I/O and event driven. The main advantage of node is that its asynchronous in nature which means that you don’t have to wait for a request to complete before making another one which in turn provides a very high performance. This course is made in so much easy way so that one who doesn’t have any knowledge of NODEJS can easily understand and hence build own scrapper in NODEJS.

We are using Selenium which is automation testing tool that provides various elements and methods to interact with HTML DOM in order to parse the website.
